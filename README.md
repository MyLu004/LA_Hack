## Inspiration
This application not only aims to streamline elderly healthcare and medication management for caregivers but also serves as a personal reminder and tracking system for individuals, promoting self-care and well-being.

## What it does
MedAssist allows users to capture images of their prescribed medication and provides detailed information about each medication along with a personalized schedule for consumption. The data is securely stored in the system, enabling reminders and monitoring of medication intake.

## How we built it
We utilized React Native for the frontend development and integrated Gemini 1.5 API for backend functionality. Recognizing the specific needs of elderly users, we designed the app with accessibility in mind, ensuring ease of use for those residing in the Irvine area.

## Challenges we ran into
Throughout the development process, we encountered various challenges, such as integrating third-party APIs, optimizing user experience for elderly users, and implementing robust data management systems.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We take pride in delivering a polished and functional product that addresses real-world healthcare needs. Our collaborative efforts have resulted in an intuitive and user-friendly application tailored for elderly users.

## What we learned
This project provided us with valuable experience in starting a project from scratch and collaborating effectively in a team setting. We gained insights into frontend development with React Native and honed our skills in problem-solving and project management.

## What's next for MedAssist
In the future, we aim to leverage the gathered data to offer enhanced features such as automated scheduling and reminders. Additionally, we plan to integrate database functionality to provide caregivers with access to patient information and medication history, further improving the quality of care provided.
